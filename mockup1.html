			I used to think that yoga was something my parents did to embarrass me in front of my friends in junior high. But 20 years ago, recovering from a back injury, I began practicing asana and discovered something I had been seeking for years: the manifestation of meditation through motion. Over the years, I developed a signature style which integrates the breath based flow of Astanga and the precision of Iyengar into a deep, sweaty and transformative mind/body experience. Opening Kula was my attempt to bring a little California vibe to the mean streets of NYC. Abundant love and thanks to the Kula family who have made this a REAL kula or “intentional community” - as well as the coolest hang out in the world for my three daughters, who will no doubt find me excruciatingly embarrassing in about 10 years. (I am also lucky enough to be the co-creator of the magical Wanderlust Festival - which is not to be missed. wanderlustfestival.com for eye candy.)

			Born in Los Angeles and relocating several times while growing up, my life was shaped by a wide array of experiences, people, and places. When my older brother turned me onto yoga during a low time over 16 years ago, my perspective shifted even further, and I've been dedicated to the continual waves of my yoga practice ever since. Maybe this has all tinted my need to move and teach from an endless plethora of inspiration, or my appetite for adventure and travel, or to my continual search for balance. In class, on global retreats, and one-on-one yoga/lifestyle sessions, I share what has most informed my own wellbeing through the years, and it keeps evolving. Inspired by many teachers, tedious life obstacles, and the intelligent sweat of Kula, my classes are full of vigor and grace with an acute focus on the connections between breath to movement, head to heart, and feet to core. I like to challenge these dynamics so you can experience a steadiness and knowing of your own body that you can take with you into every cell and aspect of life. Music moves me deeply, which I share through thoughtfully created playlists and my weekly live 'Yoga Soundscape' events. Come join me and find out more: www.yogaofnourishment.com
